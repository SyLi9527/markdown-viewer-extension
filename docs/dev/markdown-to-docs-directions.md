# Markdown to Docs/Word Opportunity Directions (Reddit-derived)

Date: 2026-02-03
Source: Reddit pain-signal searches across r/ObsidianMD, r/Markdown, r/GoogleDocs, r/LaTeX, r/technicalwriting.

## 1) Obsidian -> Google Docs collaboration export
- Pain: Copy/paste loses formatting and embeds; no clean one-click pipeline.
- Wedge: Export selected notes to a Google Doc with headings, lists, images, and TOC.
- Validate: r/ObsidianMD, r/GoogleDocs.

## 2) Obsidian -> DOCX without Pandoc
- Pain: Pandoc install/config is too heavy for non-technical users.
- Wedge: Local, zero-setup DOCX export with theme templates.
- Validate: r/ObsidianMD.

## 3) Markdown -> DOCX fidelity (lists/tables/styles)
- Pain: Lists, tables, and nested formatting break in DOCX exports.
- Wedge: Purpose-built renderer focused on Word layout parity.
- Validate: r/Markdown.

## 4) Markdown -> Google Docs API importer
- Pain: Docs API requires verbose JSON; no simple Markdown-to-Docs tooling.
- Wedge: CLI/web importer that maps Markdown blocks to Docs API requests.
- Validate: r/GoogleDocs, r/Markdown.

## 5) Teacher worksheets from Markdown
- Pain: Need fill-in blanks and structured worksheets in Docs; manual formatting is slow.
- Wedge: Convert placeholders into tables/fields and export to Google Docs/Word.
- Validate: r/Teachers, r/GoogleDocs.

## 6) Longform Markdown -> DOCX/EPUB with stable layout
- Pain: Large documents lose sections or formatting on export.
- Wedge: Chapter-aware export with consistent styles and page breaks.
- Validate: r/Markdown, r/scrivener, r/writing.

## 7) LaTeX/Markdown -> Word for academic submission
- Pain: Supervisors/journals require Word; LaTeX conversion is brittle.
- Wedge: Equation-preserving DOCX export (MathML/OMML), citations preserved.
- Validate: r/LaTeX, r/academia.

## 8) Batch export: folder/vault -> DOCX or Docs
- Pain: Need to export an entire project at once; tools are single-note only.
- Wedge: Folder/vault selection with compiled TOC and merged output.
- Validate: r/ObsidianMD, r/Markdown.

## 9) Diagrams/plots embedded in Markdown -> DOCX
- Pain: Mermaid/Graphviz/Charts require manual screenshots.
- Wedge: Auto-render diagrams to PNG/SVG and embed in DOCX.
- Validate: r/Markdown, r/ObsidianMD.

## 10) AI/meeting notes Markdown -> Word/Docs templates
- Pain: Notes need to be delivered as polished reports; manual cleanup is expensive.
- Wedge: Template-driven export (minutes, weekly report, proposal).
- Validate: r/sideproject, r/productivity, r/consulting.
